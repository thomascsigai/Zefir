**Zefir** is a lightweight and simple 2D game engine built with **C++** and **SDL2**.
Designed to go *against the wind*, Zefir gives you just enough to build focused, expressive 2D games — and nothing more.

## Games made with Zefir :

1. **[Fireball Fiasco](https://github.com/thomascsigai/Fireball-Fiasco)**  
   A game where you play a clumsy wizard that has to dodge his own magic.

3. **[CPPong](https://github.com/thomascsigai/CPPong)**  
   A remake of the classic Pong arcade game.
